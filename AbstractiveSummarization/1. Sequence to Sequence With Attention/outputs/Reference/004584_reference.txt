b'england captain alastair cook has been working on a new batting stance .'
b'his new stance has his front foot too far out without protecting the wicket .'
b"as a result , he does n't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself ."
b'cook probably overdid his new stance against the west indies .'
b"still , he should n't be written off just yet and impressed in training ."
