australia has declared its ambassador to indonesia for consultations after two australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early wednesday .
australian prime minister tony abbott called the executions `` cruel and unnecessary '' because both men , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , had been `` fully inseminated '' during a decade in prison .
