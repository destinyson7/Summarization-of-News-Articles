randy and jodi [UNK] , from [UNK] , ohio , took their own lives this week , more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help .
the couple had been living without gas all winter , having no running water and were close to having their electricity and internet service shut off .
the [UNK] were hoping to raise $ 1,000 , but the online campaign failed to draw any donations .
