christianne boudreau thought her son damien clairmont was going to egypt to study arabic in 2013 , but canadian authorities later told the calgary mother that her son had instead gone to turkey where he crossed the border into syria to join isis .
while damien had become more extreme in his islamic ideology before he left canada , ms boudreau never imagined her shy and peaceful son would actually become a jihadi .
