uefa has opened a real can of worms by ordering the final 18 seconds of the european women 's under 19 championship qualifier between england and norway to be replayed following a refereeing error .
this happened in the 38th minute and fifa ordered that the entire match be replayed which did not please either team .
england are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute .
