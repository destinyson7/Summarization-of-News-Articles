west ham manager sam allardyce says he would have no problem with sneaking through the ` back door ' into european football via the fair play league .
the hammers started the season strongly and looked a good bet for european qualification around christmas before their form fell away , with a mid-table finish now all-but certain .
the hammers have won once in their last 10 league matches and drew 1-1 against stoke in their last match .
