the tateyama kurobe alpine route opened for visitors today , with tourists marvelling at the 65ft high walls .
it is hoped the march 14 opening of the sightseeing route operator hokuriku shinkansen line , which connects toyama station with tokyo station , will help to bump the numbers back up to the frozen passage last year .
