five staff members left the royal easter show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed super slide .
it is understood the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride .
the slide underwent a safety check sunday morning and was cleared for use , as long as there was n't another downpour .
