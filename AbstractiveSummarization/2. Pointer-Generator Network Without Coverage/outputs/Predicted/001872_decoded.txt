ben stokes starred with the ball on the first day of england 's warm-up match in st kitts , but it was the runs of alastair cook and jonathan trott that pleased him most .
england dominated against a modest st kitts & nevis xi , dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply .
the quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session .
