tony pulis returned to selhurst park for the first time since he left crystal palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his west bromwich albion side to the edge of safety .
alan pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit pulis but an early goal from james morrison and stunner from craig gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left palace two days before this season kicked off .
they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season .
