alannah hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin .
she was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanoma and if she had waited another three months the cancer would likely have spread and become terminal but thankfully she now has a ` very good ' prognosis .
