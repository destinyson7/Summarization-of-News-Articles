felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at john f kennedy international airport .
the two-year-old grey tabby belongs to jennifer stewart , 31 , and her 34-year-old husband , joseph naaman , who said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly -- apparently while being transferred from the plane -- that felix was able to get out and run away .
she said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open .
