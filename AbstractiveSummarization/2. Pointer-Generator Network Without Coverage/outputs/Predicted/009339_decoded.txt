stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month .
they had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand , apparently with the full consent of safety staff .
they are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells .
