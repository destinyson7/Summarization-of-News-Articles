aston villa manager tim sherwood has vowed to give pal chris ramsey the red-button treatment if he tries calling him ahead of tuesday 's crunch six-pointer .
ramsey , who was sherwood 's closest lieutenant at tottenham last season , had at the weekend vowed to take the unusual step of trying to make contact with his opposing manager ahead of the game .
sherwood has guided villa to an fa cup semi-final , with blackburn or liverpool lying in wait on sunday week .
