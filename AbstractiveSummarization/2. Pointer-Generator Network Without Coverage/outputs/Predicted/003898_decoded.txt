china 's ding junhui suffered a bizarre lapse of concentration which ended his chance of a rare maximum 147 break at the world snooker championship on tuesday .
the world no 3 realised what he had done and held his head in his hands before starting to giggle along with his first-round opponent mark davis .
ding was n't able to continue his break to pocket # 30,000 at the crucible theatre in sheffield .
