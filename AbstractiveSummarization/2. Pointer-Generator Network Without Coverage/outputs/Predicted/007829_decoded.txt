researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in ileret , northwest kenya , have now found a total of 99 prints .
they now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud .
