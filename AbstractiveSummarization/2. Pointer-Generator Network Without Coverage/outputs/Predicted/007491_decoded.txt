yelp , founded in 2004 by two former paypal employees , is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor 's offices .
however , like many web businesses , yelp 's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site .
