robert lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer .
lewandowski spent four years at dortmund , leading them to back-to-back league titles during that period , and offered only a muted celebration when he pounced to give the visitors the lead 10 minutes before half time .
weidenfeller complains to his defence as lewandowski makes his way to his feet after scoring .
