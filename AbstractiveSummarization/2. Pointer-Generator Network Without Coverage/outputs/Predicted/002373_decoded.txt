reanne evans , a single mum from dudley , was a winner on thursday night .
she advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that wo n't be bettered in this year 's qualifying tournament .
snooker 's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the blue-chip event on april 18 .
