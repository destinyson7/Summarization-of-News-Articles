former queens park rangers chairman gianni paladini has registered as a director of a new bradford city holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at valley parade .
paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left loftus road in 2011 and has attempted to buy birmingham city from carson yeung .
the italian seems to have enjoyed more success in west yorkshire where he has forged an official link to bradford .
