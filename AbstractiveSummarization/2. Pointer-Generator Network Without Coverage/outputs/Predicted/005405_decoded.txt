the labour party will launch a billboard advert using an image from the famous 1979 ` labour is n't working ' poster , but instead it will warn : ` the doctor ca n't see you now ' the poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under jim callaghan 's ailing government , but this time places them outside a waiting room .
it will also claim nearly two million more patients are unhappy with doctors opening hours compared to three years ago .
