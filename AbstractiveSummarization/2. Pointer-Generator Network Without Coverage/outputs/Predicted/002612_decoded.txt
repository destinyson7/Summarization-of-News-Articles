barcelona threw away a two-goal lead against sevilla thanks to individual errors by claudio bravo and gerard pique .
a year ago barcelona travelled to andalusia to face granada and left a beaten side , their title challenge hitting an iceberg .
this was not as brutal a blow , but enrique 's team will need to right themselves quickly ahead of a testing fortnight .
