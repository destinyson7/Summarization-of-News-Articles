hillary clinton ended her whirlwind new hampshire campaign swing on tuesday afternoon in another state entirely , taking taxpayers for an 80 miles-per-hour ride all the way to boston .
her motorcade passed exits to the manchester , n.h. airport , which was 55 miles closer and offered a 5:16 p.m. flight to the same destination .
the manchester flight was scheduled to use a smaller plane with nothing but coach .
