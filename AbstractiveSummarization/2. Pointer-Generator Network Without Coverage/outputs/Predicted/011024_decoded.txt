the mid-size ship , with an on-board climbing wall , is sailing away from rci to thomson and will get a new name , yet to be announced .
it is good news that tried and tested , smaller ships built on classic lines do not just sail off into the sunset or to the breaker 's yard , but are reinvented and relaunched , sometimes several times over .
