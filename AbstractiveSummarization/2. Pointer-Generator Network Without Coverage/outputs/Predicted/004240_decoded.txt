supporters of isis have ` declared a caliphate ' in yemen through a bizarre video showing a group of masked fighters a barren desert .
the ` establishing ' of an isis-related group in yemen comes after months of conflict which has seen iran-backed houthi rebels fight both the government and the local al qaeda affiliates .
last month , the isis-related group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks .
