the horse , charly , was patrolling venice beach with his minders on tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred .
it was broad daylight , and somehow the person managed to spray charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on , but usually with stationary objects and facades .
the paint was cleaned off charly later on tuesday night without a problem .
