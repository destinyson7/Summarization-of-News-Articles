damon muller has almost doubled in size due to swelling and bloating since he was diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis -lrb- jdm -rrb- in november - a rare autoimmune disease .
the disease has robbed damon , from gladstone in central queensland , of the ability to run , ride his bike and play outside freely in the sun - something his mother nicci moynahan says has been very difficult .
he has already been rushed to hospital once after his neck started swelling so much it almost closed his throat .
