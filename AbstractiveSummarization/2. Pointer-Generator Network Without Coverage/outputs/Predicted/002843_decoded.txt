rafa nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect , confidence-boosting start with a 6-2 , 6-1 win over frenchman lucas pouille in the monte carlo masters .
it was a businesslike display from the world no 5 .
he did n't unleash the full power of his forehand but played sensible , measured tennis and made only five unforced errors in the match .
