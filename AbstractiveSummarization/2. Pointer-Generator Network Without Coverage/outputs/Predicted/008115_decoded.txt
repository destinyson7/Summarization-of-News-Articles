whistleblower julian asssange has added insult to injury for sony pictures after his website wikileaks put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year 's cyberattack into a searchable online archive .
assange and wikileaks issued a statement on thursday saying that the data has a public interest , but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal .
they expose not just the unguarded opinions of sony executives , but also reveal health concerns about their children and sadness over dying parents .
