clint gee made the almost six hour journey from his home outside brisbane to wandoan in regional queensland , only to find the local council failed to dig a spot where he could place his mother 's ashes .
mr gee makes the journey to the site every year to remember his father , and this year he wanted to follow through on a promise he made to his mother to reunite the pair .
