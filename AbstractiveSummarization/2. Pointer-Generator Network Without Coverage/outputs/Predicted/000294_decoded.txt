the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago , about 18 miles -lrb- 30 kilometers -rrb- from one of the front lines with isis , where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes .
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar .
