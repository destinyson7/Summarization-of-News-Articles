the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown .
the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours .
it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator .
