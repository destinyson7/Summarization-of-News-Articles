ben crenshaw will mark his 44th and last consecutive appearance in the masters by standing in for arnold palmer in the masters .
palmer is unable to play alongside gary player and jack nicklaus in the curtain-raising event on wednesday afternoon as he recovers from a dislocated shoulder .
the winner of the par three contest has never gone on to win the tournament proper in the same year .
