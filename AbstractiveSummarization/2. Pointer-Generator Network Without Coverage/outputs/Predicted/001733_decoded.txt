leicester boss nigel pearson would have had the ` outstanding ' esteban cambiasso down as his man of the match in saturday 's 2-1 win over west ham even if the veteran foxes midfielder had not scored .
cambiasso netted with a sweet strike in the 12th minute to put his side 1-0 up at the king power stadium , hitting the ball first time from just outside the box after it had sat up for him from a ricochet .
leicester remain rooted to the bottom of the table .
