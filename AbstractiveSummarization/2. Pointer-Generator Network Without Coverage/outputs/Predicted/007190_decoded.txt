graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of santiago de compostela , in north-western spain .
but no one knows who put up the signs , which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it .
the signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter .
