more than 200 yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern iraq last summer .
most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said nuri osman .
the freed yazidis were received by peshmerga , who sent them to the kurdish regional capital .
