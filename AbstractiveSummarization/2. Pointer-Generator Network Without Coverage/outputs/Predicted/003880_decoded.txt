marlon samuels found a novel way of carrying on his duel in the second test with a military-style salute .
he had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a devendra bishoo straight to deep square leg and samuels wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds .
the durham all-rounder muttered under his breath as he walked past samuels before england closed on 373 for six , a lead of 74 .
