danielle and alexander meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son rafi , 10 , and daughter dvora , 6 , roam free in their suburban neighborhood .
the meitivs , both of them scientists , say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up rafi and dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents .
the meitivs made headlines just before christmas when police found rafi and dvora walking the sidewalk on their own .
