caleb benn , a californian high school student , recently developed a $ 4.99 -lrb- # 3.24 -rrb- app for ios devices using instagram 's application program interface .
it allows users to upload photos to instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone .
the teenager is currently making $ 1,000 -lrb- # 675.70 -rrb- a day from the app -- and instagram is n't happy .
