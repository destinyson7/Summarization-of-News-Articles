franck ribery has dismissed reports linking wolfsburg forward kevin de bruyne with bayern munich as a potential replacement for the former france international or his team-mate arjen robben .
de bruyne , who spent his two years at chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed bundesliga club , has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league 's assist charts with 16 -- seven more than the next best .
