b'before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get the person with dementia to focus on you . there can be a tendency for them to look away and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation .'
b"be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process . for example , if they 're upset do n't ask what 's wrong as they may not know , or are unable to put it into words . instead , tell them : ` you seem to be upset ; let 's think how we can make you feel better . '"
b"finishing sentences for them can increase frustration . it 's better to ask if they 'd like you to find words for them if they 're having difficulty ."
b'watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling . for example , repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared , while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed .'
b"if they 're doing something obviously wrong , for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard , do n't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration ."
