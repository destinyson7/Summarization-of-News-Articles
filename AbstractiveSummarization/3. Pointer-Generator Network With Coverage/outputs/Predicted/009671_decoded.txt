the islamic extremists drove cars to a mosque in the remote village of kwajafa in borno state , where they told locals they were there to teach islam .
once a crowd had gathered around the men , the jihadis opened fire using handguns and assault rifles before setting fire to nearby houses that were filled with unsuspecting families .
the attack came as new pictures showed how teenagers caught up in previous slaughters carried out by boko haram .
