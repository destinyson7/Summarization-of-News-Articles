arizona officials who botched an investigation into the rape of a 13-year-old girl - allowing her rapist to continue to assault her for four years - have agreed to pay her $ 3.5 million .
the payout by maricopa county , which was revealed on wednesday , comes after it emerged that patrick morrison continued to assault the mentally-disabled girl , his niece , and even got her pregnant when detectives failed to properly investigate the case .
