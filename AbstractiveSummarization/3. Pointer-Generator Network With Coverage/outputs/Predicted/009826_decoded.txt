a coast guard cutter arrived in san diego on thursday with more than 14 tons of cocaine .
the cocaine , valued by the coast guard at $ 424 million , was seized by u.s. and canadian forces in 19 separate incidents in the eastern pacific ocean near central and south america .
it included a 10 1/2 - ton bust from a coastal freighter , the largest maritime drug interdiction in that area since 2009 .
