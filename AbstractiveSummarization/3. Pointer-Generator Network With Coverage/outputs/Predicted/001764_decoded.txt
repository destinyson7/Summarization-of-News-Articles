roma players ordered to close part of their stadium for their next home game after supporters were sanctioned for showing an offensive banner over the weekend .
the banner , displayed during roma 's 1-0 defeat of napoli on saturday , caused outcry for insulting the mother of a napoli fan who was killed in violent clashes between supporters last year .
roma will have part of their stadium closed for the league match with atalanta on april 19 .
