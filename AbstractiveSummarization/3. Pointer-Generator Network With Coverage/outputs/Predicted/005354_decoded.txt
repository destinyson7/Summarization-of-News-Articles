a ginger tabby cat sneaked inside a shipping container in egypt before embarking on a mammoth 3,000 mile trip to herefordshire - without food and water .
the kitten , who has since been named sinbad , was discovered by puzzled staff at mediterranean linens in moreton-on-lugg , hereford .
they heard meows coming from inside the container , which was carrying laundry linen .
