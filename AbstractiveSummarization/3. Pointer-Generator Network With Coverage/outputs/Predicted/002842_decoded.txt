jordan spieth admitted he would probably sleep in the green jacket after claiming his first major title in record-breaking fashion in the 79th masters .
spieth became the first player ever to reach 19 under par at augusta and only a bogey on the 18th prevented him from adding the 72-hole scoring record to the 36 and 54-hole records he set on friday and saturday .
