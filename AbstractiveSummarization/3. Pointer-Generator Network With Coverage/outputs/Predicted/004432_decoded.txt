robby mccrorie handed celtic the glasgow cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at hampden .
josh kerr took advantage when the scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the hoops in front before mccrorie dropped a mark hill free kick over the line .
with old firm bosses ronny deila and stuart mccall looking on , it was the former who left happiest after seeing tommy mcintyre 's side record a deserved victory .
