michael brelo , 31 , made his first appearance in court in cleveland , ohio , on monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of timothy russell , 43 , and malissa williams , 30 .
he is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting .
