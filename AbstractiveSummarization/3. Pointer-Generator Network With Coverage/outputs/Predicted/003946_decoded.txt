mauricio pochettino has blamed tottenham 's lunchtime lethargy this season on the europa league campaign .
of 10 barclays premier league matches kicking off at 12.00 , 12.45 or 1.30 , spurs have won two - against qpr last august and arsenal in february - collecting nine points out of a possible 30 .
six of the matches followed europa league games on thursday nights , and spurs lost four of those and drew the other two .
