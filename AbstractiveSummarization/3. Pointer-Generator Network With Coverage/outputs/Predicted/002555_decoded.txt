foxxy cleopatra and the reptile called ryuu can be seen chasing after one another around a coffee table .
standing perfectly still while looking in the other direction , the bearded dragon initially appears disinterested as the chihuahua jumps around excitedly .
the reptile then turns to face the dog , causing it to bark , run off and watch from a safe distance behind the table .
