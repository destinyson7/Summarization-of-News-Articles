florida court heard how bryan santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the orlando home he shared with shelby fazio , 23 , before waiting for the young woman to return , killing her and then abusing her body in october last year .
jurors were told santana first choked fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife .
