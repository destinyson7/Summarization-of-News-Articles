lyon moved back to the top of ligue 1 for 24 hours at least after claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory at guingamp .
nabil fekir 's goal and guingamp 's hopes of a comeback took a blow when christophe kerbrat was given his marching orders before half-time .
clinton n'jie struck just after the hour to put hubert fournier 's side three goals to the good , meaning claudio beauvue 's effort 10 minutes from time was only a consolation .
