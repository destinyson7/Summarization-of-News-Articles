real madrid failed to activate their first option on javier hernandez as the deadline passed on thursday night .
the midnight deadline went by without madrid making a formal offer to buy the manchester united striker outright .
hernandez , 26 , has impressed in the last few weeks with five goals in his last six games including the decisive strike against atletico madrid .
