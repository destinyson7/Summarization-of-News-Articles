chris hala'ufia flattened a streaker and was then sent off for a brutal attack on leicester forward laurence pearce during saturday 's aviva premiership clash .
the tongan number eight , who has been warned in the past over his ill-discipline , halted pearce in his tracks with a shoulder charge and left him prone on the ground .
after studying replays on the big screen , referee tim wigglesworth showed hala'ufia a yellow card and then changed it to red .
