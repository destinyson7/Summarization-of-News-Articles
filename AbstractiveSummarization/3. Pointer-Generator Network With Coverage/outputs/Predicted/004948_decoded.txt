sydneysiders missed out on saturday night 's lunar eclipse , but melbourne and adelaide residents had a spectacular view of the ` blood moon ' as it lit up the sky .
wet and cloudy weather was to blame in sydney , where the sydney observatory said the short lunar began at 10.58 pm -lrb- aedt -rrb- and finished at 11.03 pm .
