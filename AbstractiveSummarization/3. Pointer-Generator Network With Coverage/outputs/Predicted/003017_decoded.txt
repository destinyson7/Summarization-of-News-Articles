england 's new record wicket-taker james anderson promised there is more to come as he believes he is still improving as a bowler .
anderson induced an edge from west indies captain denesh ramdin on the final day of the first test in antigua for his 384th test scalp on friday , breaking sir ian botham 's record which had stood for 23 years .
anderson , 32 , broke the record in the same match which saw him collect his landmark 100th cap for england .
