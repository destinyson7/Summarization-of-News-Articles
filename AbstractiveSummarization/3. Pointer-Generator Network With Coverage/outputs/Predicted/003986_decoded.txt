patrice evra believes juventus called upon quintessential italian traits in securing their route to the champions league semi-finals .
massimiliano allegri 's team secured a 0-0 draw at the stade louis ii on wednesday night , meaning they progressed 1-0 on aggregate , after arturo vidal 's second-half penalty proved the difference in turin last week .
evra withstood a few nervous moments as juventus sat back and allowed the french side to dictate the play .
