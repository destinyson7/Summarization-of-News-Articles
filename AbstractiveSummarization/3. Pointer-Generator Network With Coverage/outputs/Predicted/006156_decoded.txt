four men have been moved out of intensive care after suspected drug overdoses during a party cruise on sydney harbour , possibly due to a dangerous strain of ecstasy pills known as ` blue scissors ' .
the men - two 21-year-olds and a 25 and a 25 and 22-year-old - collapsed on the vessel on good friday , forcing it to dock near the opera house .
