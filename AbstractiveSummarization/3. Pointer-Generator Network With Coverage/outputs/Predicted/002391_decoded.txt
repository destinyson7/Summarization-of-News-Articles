ben stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd test wicket when jermaine blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to alastair cook .
but the durham all-rounder 's front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve .
it 's not the first time this has happened to stokes , of course -- a similar error saw him denied his first test wicket against australia in adelaide in 2013 .
