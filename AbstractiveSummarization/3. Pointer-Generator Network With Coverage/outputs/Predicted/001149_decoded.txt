ronald koeman will wait for a more accurate date for fraser forster 's return before deciding whether an additional goalkeeper must be signed in the summer .
forster underwent knee surgery after falling awkwardly in the 2-0 victory over burnley a fortnight ago and estimates for his comeback have ranged from four to 12 months .
koeman is reluctant to give a more precise time frame for the england international and views kelvin davis as a capable deputy .
