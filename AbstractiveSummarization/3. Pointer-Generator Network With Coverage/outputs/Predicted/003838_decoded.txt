rafael nadal 's bid for a ninth barcelona open title ended in third-round defeat as italian fabio fognini edged a hard-fought encounter 6-4 , 7-6 -lrb- 8-6 -rrb- to move into the quarter-finals .
second-seed nadal had easily seen off nicolas almagro in the previous round but found himself in trouble against fognini , who had won in three sets in their previous meeting on the clay of rio earlier this year .
fognini was able to save six break points in the opening game before conceding it to nadal .
