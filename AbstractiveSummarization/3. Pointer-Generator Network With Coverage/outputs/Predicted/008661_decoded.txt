brisbane 's anglican archbishop has joined a local catholic priest in calling for queensland 's controversial ` gay panic ' homicide defence to be removed from queensland common law .
the defence means a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter if the defendant establishes their victim ` came on ' to them , and the killing was in self-defence .
