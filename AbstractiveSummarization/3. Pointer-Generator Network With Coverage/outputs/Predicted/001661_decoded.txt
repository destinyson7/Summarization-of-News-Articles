liverpool and arsenal fans united to protest against the rising price of football for travelling fans .
# 64 a ticket ' read one banner , held across the home and away fans before kick-off .
hopefully the irony was n't lost on sterling , even if it did not interfere with his football .
it was a difficult afternoon for raheem sterling , who toiled as arsenal surged to victory over liverpool .
