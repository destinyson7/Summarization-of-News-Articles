olivia grant headed to phuket in thailand before the start of filming the second series .
at the end of filming channel 4 's indian summers last year , i headed to koh phangan , an island off ko samui , and did a week-long meditation and yoga course .
so i jumped at the chance of heading out to thailand again before the start of filming the second series .
first of all it is much greener , and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones '
