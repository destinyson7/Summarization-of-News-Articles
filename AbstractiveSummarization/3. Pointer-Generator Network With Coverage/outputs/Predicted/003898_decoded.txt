china 's ding junhui suffered a bizarre lapse of concentration which ended his chance of a rare maximum 147 break at the world snooker championship on tuesday .
ding potted 12 reds and 12 blacks to rack up 96 points but after knocking in the 13th red he screwed back up the table to get position on the blue .
the world no 3 realised what he had done and held his head in his hands before starting to giggle along with his first-round opponent mark davis .
