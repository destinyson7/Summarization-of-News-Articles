britain 's biggest purpose-built air raid shelter , which could hold 6,500 people , was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets .
the tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the river mersey in stockport in the 1930s .
but following the outbreak of the second world war , the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of lancashire and cheshire could hide from nazi bombs .
