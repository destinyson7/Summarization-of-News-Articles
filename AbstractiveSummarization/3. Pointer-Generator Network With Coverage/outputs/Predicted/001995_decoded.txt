arsene wenger admits he did not expect arsenal 's late charge for the top of the premier league to be powered by hector bellerin and francis coquelin .
wenger had all but given up on coquelin when he was sent on loan to charlton before christmas and did not expect bellerin to progress with such speed after a year at watford .
