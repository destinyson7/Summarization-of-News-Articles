mario mandzukic is still bruised from a physical champions league quarter-final first leg against real madrid .
the croatian suffered a cut to the top of the nose from an elbow by sergio ramos and fellow real defender dani carvajal punched him in the stomach , an incident unseen by the referee , during the clash at the calderon that ended 0-0 .
mandzukic also suffered an ankle injury that forced him to miss saturday 's 2-1 win at deportivo la coruna .
