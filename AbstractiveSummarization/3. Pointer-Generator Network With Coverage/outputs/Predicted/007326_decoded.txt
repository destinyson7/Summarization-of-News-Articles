kent sprouse was put to death by lethal injection thursday night in texas .
sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago .
a jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death , and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 .
