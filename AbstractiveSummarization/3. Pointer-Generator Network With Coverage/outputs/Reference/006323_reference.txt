b'fbi director james comey suggested in remarks last week that poles were accomplices during the holocaust .'
b"comey 's comments are offensive to poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the third reich ."
b'poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized , making the comments yet more hurtful .'
b'the remarks came shortly before the 72nd anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising , which was commemorated on sunday .'
b'the u.s. ambassador to poland , stephen mull , was called to the foreign ministry in a formal act of protest .'
b"the incident echoes a gaffe by president obama in 2012 when he referred to ' a polish death camp ' - he offered his regrets for the error ."
