integrity .","Like a foundation for any well-constructed house , integrity is the core foundation for leadership effectiveness .","It is a blend of honesty , consistency and ethics .","Once integrity is squandered or even thrown into doubt , it is very hard for a leader to regain the trust of his or her troops .","Passion .","Yet integrity alone does n't matter without several other key attributes .","Passion , for example , enables a leader to keep moving forward even in tough times .","Jeff Bezos , the CEO of Amazon , was ridiculed in 2001 for clinging to a company that many called \"

the company was teetering on the brink of collapse .","Courage .","Courage , another make-it-or-break-it quality , is necessary to make the difficult decisions when facing conflicts and mediating adversity .","Courage springs from a leader 's core values and commitment to a vision .","Vision .","Without a compelling vision or destination , how can a boss effectively persuade people to embark upon a new direction ?","Visionary leaders inspire employees to imagine a better future and work hard to achieve it .","Steve Jobs : How to lead with purpose .","Judgment .","Actually achieving this vision , however , requires judgment .","Good judgment allows the leader to make solid business decisions and choices .","When I assess an aspiring leader , I want to see whether she can confront a complex new challenge and quickly zero in on the most important issues .","Does she ask good questions ?","Can she prioritize and make difficult tradeoffs ?","Does she know where to focus and where not to waste her time and energy ?","Even when looking at an individual piece of the problem , does she keep the entire chessboard in mind , recognizing the potential unintended consequences of her decisions ?","Judgment is needed to develop a strategy that will enable the organization to achieve its vision .","Empathy .","No matter the organization , diversity of its people is the one constant .","Each team member has a different personality , motivation and underlying agenda .","Empathy is the attribute that allows a leader to effectively understand what makes other people tick .","Identifying the fundamental drivers of their bosses , peers and subordinates is critical .","Same goes for getting people aligned and motivated around their common goals .","Outside your specific organization , it is invaluable that a leader be able to quickly and accurately figure out why an important customer seems dissatisfied , even though they say everything is fine .","If a potential employee does n't have empathy , they have very little chance of getting these , and many other , important constituents on their side .","Lack of empathy is a key reason why otherwise analytically brilliant leaders often come up short .","Emotional intelligence .","While empathy is externally focused , another key leadership attribute , emotional intelligence , is internally focused .","An emotionally intelligent leader habitually takes a hard , honest look at himself and accurately discerns his strengths , weaknesses and blind spots .","Putting personal pride aside , he actively solicits the input of others and incorporates the team 's best ideas into the overall action plan .","Without emotional intelligence , hubris sets in , and a leader will overestimate his own ability and alienate others .","Even though the hubris may convince him that he can bite off more than he can chew , subordinates will not be so blind .","A leader who continuously lets down his or her team wo n't stay in the organization 's good graces for long .","From my vantage point , a lack of emotional intelligence is probably the top derailer of previously successful managers moving into fundamentally new and ambiguous roles .","These seven leadership attributes -- integrity , vision , judgment , passion , courage , empathy and emotional intelligence -- are all the hallmarks of great leaders , regardless of industry or geography .","By gearing any candidate assessment towards these traits -- and away from false predictors of success , like a sparkling personality , a polished

in the face of stiff LCD-based tablet competition , they 're innovating .","The latest update comes from Barnes & Noble , which added an LED-based \" GlowLight \" to its Nook Simple Touch e-reader .","The 6.5 x 5-inch device is not remarkably different from the e-reader Barnes & Noble introduced last year .","Its dimensions are , in fact , virtually unchanged .","But despite the new lighting

the Kindle Keyboard 3G .","Barnes & Noble is not the first to offer an E Ink reader with built-in LED lighting .","Sony did it first a few years ago , but eventually discontinued the larger and more

all the way up ( the default , which was set to about 1\/3 power , was not bright enough for me ) .","The light across the screen is n't perfectly uniform , but it is highly readable and very comfortable on the eyes .","Even after my wife powered down and went to sleep , she did n't complain about my GlowLight .","I also found the touchscreen , which works either with a tap or a sweep of the finger ( forward to turn the page and back to turn back the page ) , worked perfectly and made me wish my Kindle 2 was also a touch-screen device .","Barnes & Noble promises that the Nook Simple Touch 's battery life will last for 30 days with an hour of GlowLight-enabled reading a night .","I 've had the ereader a few days and charged it once .","My original plan was to leave the GlowLight running and test if it could run , as Barnes & Noble told me , for 60 continuous hours .","The device 's own auto-sleep settings scuttled that plan by putting the Simple Touch to sleep after five minutes of inactivity .","Overall , Barnes & Noble Nook","Simple Touch with GlowLight is a winner .","It 's easy to setup ( entering a Wi-Fi password is easy thanks to the touch screen ) , feels great

{"story":["( CNN ) --","Since the early days of pop music , the music industry has been searching for the secret formula to writing a successful song -- for that special alchemy that separates a Grammy-winner from a dud .","For a period in the 1970s and 80s , the self-styled King of Pop Michael Jackson seemed to have stumbled upon it , but somewhere along the line he , too , seems to have misplaced it .","Hit Song Science claims to be able to predict whether a song will be a pop hit .","But now a piece of software claims it can compute whether a song has chart-topping potential , and a number of record companies and musicians are using Hit Song Science ( HSS ) to gauge whether they have a hit on their hands .","The software , developed by Barcelona-based Music Intelligence Solutions , works by breaking down more than 60 elements of a song , including melody , harmony , tempo , pitch , octave , beat , rhythm , fullness of sound , noise , brilliance and chord progression , and compares it against a database of over 3.5 million past commercial hits .","The program organizes songs into clusters with similar-sounding equivalents and then rates the song on a scale of one to ten , with a score of 7.3 being deemed likely to do well in the music charts .","Curiously , clusters of songs do not necessarily contain songs that sound the same to the human ear , but from a mathematical perspective they share similarities .","HSS analyzed music from Norah Jones ' first album before she broke through and the program 's algorithms placed her in a cluster with Linkin Park , Aerosmith and JayZ .","If you have ever wondered why you sometimes find yourself humming along to some smooth jazz on the radio when you consider yourself a strict thrash metal fan only , then perhaps HSS has discovered the scientific answer .","Besides Norah Jones , the program also predicted success for Mika , while \" Turn Your Car Around , \" a song penned by Ben Novak , a singer-songwriter from New Zealand , was rated as a potential hit by HSS , who recommended it to Sony Music in the UK .","It eventually ended up as a vehicle for ex-Blue band member Lee Ryan and scored a respectable UK chart position of 16 in 2005 .","Record producer Carlos Quintero , director of Orixe and Jamm Records in Spain , believes that the software has a high accuracy rate .","\" I was very skeptical when I was told about it for the first time , \" he says .","\" I thought it was science fiction .","\" But when we choose a tune for an artist and we like it and feel it will be a hit , the surprise is that 85 percent of the time the tracks we have chosen get a positive analysis from the software . \"","The emergence of hit prediction programs such as this -- New York-based Platinum Blue Music Intelligence provides a similar service -- raises concerns that the creative element of writing music would be eroded by breaking it down into mathematical algorithms .","But Quintero claims the program in no way writes a song , it simply tells you whether it has the potential to be a hit .","He says he mainly uses the software to tweak and refine songs so that he can maximize his chances of scoring a high chart position .","\" There was a particular case where we had to revise the song as at first it was n't completely right .","Using the software , we managed to make it work , \" he explains .","\" The problem with the software is that it can only indicate whether a song is suitable or not .","It 's up to the producer , the technical team and the artist to make it suitable in the first place . \"","Quintero has since become a member of Music Intelligence Solutions ' advisory board , so he is bound to have a positive take on the service .","Jimena Llosa , General Manager EMEA of Music Intelligence Solutions , claims the company has thirty to forty clients in the record industry in Europe and the U.S. , but she says she can not reveal who they are , citing privacy issues .","CNN attempted to contact several record companies in London , but A&R departments claimed they had not heard of the service , suggesting either a certain coyness to admit using it or that it is not as widely used as Music Intelligence claims .","The software can also be used as a way of recommending new music to audiences .","In Spain , cellular phone company Orange is using the technology in its New Talents enterprise .","Listeners can enter in their favorite songs and the program will suggest songs they might enjoy according to its cluster system .","\u00d3scar Sainz is one musician who has profited from this new way of connecting musicians with an audience .","A national tennis monitor by profession , he struggled to make an impact in the music industry despite the best efforts of Pablo Pinilla , one of Spain 's most successful music producers .","But since the Orange initiative his career has taken off and he is now selling well through Orange and touring the country .","\" A machine or at least mathematical or scientific formulas that could analyze the parameters that a song needs to be a hit ?","The truth is I doubted it at first , \" he says .","\" My first instinct was it must be a con .","\" Do n't ask me what parameters they use , or formulas , or machines they use , because I do n't know .","But it works . \"","But the software has its skeptics .","Jim Elliot , writer and producer of Kylie Minogue 's new single \" 2 Hearts \" is unconvinced about the accuracy of the program .","He entered tracks from her new Album \" X \" and they were , unsurprisingly , rated as potential hits .","But he also entered a little-known , unreleased , song by 70s band Gong that included cows mooing , and it was also rated as a potential chart-topper .","He thinks that the program negates the unpredictability of human behavior .","\"","The fact is that it 's the human errors introduced in the music-making process that are always the most interesting , \" he says .","\" Who would have thought Lily Allen would do so well ?","I doubt anyone would have predicted that .","\" It 's so hard to categorize music .","There 's a real danger of doing that .","If you are writing and producing music you can try to fit it to certain formulas","but it 's so abstract that it has to be free -- and then something good will happen . \"","With just one fifth of their musicians making a profit for today 's record companies , executives are always searching for new ways to narrow the risk margin .","Hit Song Science may become a useful string in their bow in the elusive art of

{"story":["( CNN ) --","In a place accustomed to tough stretches , this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House .","After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed , the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts : problems surrounding Obamacare , the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies , and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration 's nominations .","The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year , and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter .","But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen , they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House .","\" This is an administration that has been very , very good at its politics , but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One , \" he said Monday .","\" It 's an administration which has some really smart people in it , and a lot of younger people .","It does n't have very many heavyweights . \"","The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all -- not just the various individual fires , but more generally how to \" take control of his own government , \" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said .","If you 're the President , how do you make sure that subordinates are n't withholding information you should know ?","How do you strike the right balance , and explain it clearly , on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships ?","And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you ?","\" Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right , \" Borger writes in an analysis . \"","And now Obama probably feels the same way . \"","Does Obama still have faith in government ?","Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today : .","Obamacare .","Another week , another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama 's health insurance program .","This time , Marilyn Tavenner , head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- which is in charge of the Obamacare website -- became the first administration official to formally apologize to Americans for the troublesome start .","She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee .","\" We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage , and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use Healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage , I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should , \" she told lawmakers .","Obamacare website administrator apologizes .","The website , which would-be applicants have found difficult to use , at best , embarrassingly crashed over the weekend , leaving consumers completely locked out .","Then , the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that , despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration , some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies .","An insurance industry source told CNN Monday that the vast majority of Americans who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under Obamacare rules .","It 's been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change -- the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies would n't meet regulations allowing them to continue under what 's called \" grandfathered \" status .","That refers to plans allowed to continue even though they do n't provide all the rights and protections of those offered under Obamacare .","White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements .","\" There are existing health care plans on the individual market that do n't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act , \" he said .","\" There are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that 's substandard . \"","And those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges -- some of them at a subsidized price , he said .","But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters .","\" If you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan , \" the president said in 2009 , and frequently since .","It also offered Republicans ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan .","\" The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there , \" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday .","\" It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit with massive premium increases they ca n't afford . \"","NSA spying .","After months of seemingly endless leaks about U.S. surveillance programs , the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the German news magazine Der Spiegel that the United States was collecting the communications of allied leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .","Obamacare and NSA spying : What did Obama know ,","and when did he find out ?","German leaders respond angrily to the news , with Merkel demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country 's confidence in the United States had been \" shaken . \"","But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism -- from both the right and the left .","Rep. Peter King , the Republican chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence , was incredulous that the president did n't know what was going on .","\" He certainly should have known , if he did n't , \" the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on \" The Situation Room . \"","\" I think that 's almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it . \"","Rep. King on NSA spying :","If Obama did n't know , he should have .","And Sen.

{"story":["( CNN ) --","In the year since Steve Jobs ' death , Apple has undergone a gradual and subtle brand makeover , shaking off some of the more unpleasant characteristics associated with Jobs and taking on bits of the personality of its new leader , Tim Cook .","For all his brilliance at product design , Jobs showed little interest in glad-handing with Apple partners or investors .","By contrast , Apple from the outside has appeared more open under Cook , thanks to a number of orchestrated meetings and trips meant to appeal to the various factions -- consumers , investors and politicians -- interested in the world 's leading tech company .","In May , Cook went to Washington to meet with congressional leaders to open lines of communication that were mostly blocked in previous years .","Apple was no stranger to lobbying ( although it spends far less than some other Silicon Valley companies , like Google ) , but sending Cook was a way of letting politicians know Apple was ready to grow its relationship with Capitol Hill and that the company might take a stronger interest in policy issues in the future .","Apple also has worked harder to woo Wall Street .","There was a bus tour of investors that stopped at Apple headquarters in Cupertino , California , where they were treated to cookies and a presentation by Apple 's chief financial officer .","A more sizable act of goodwill was the cash dividend Apple paid out to investors -- the first in 17 years .","On a call with investors in February , Cook answered questions , cracked jokes and was generally open and friendly .","Did Apple 's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs ?","After an outcry over working conditions at the factories of Apple 's manufacturing partners , most notably Foxconn , Cook took swift action .","He took a trip to China and toured a Foxconn plant in person .","Apple also allowed the Fair Labor Association to do a thorough audit of conditions at the China factories , and Apple vowed to improve pay and hours .","The most recent display of the company 's shift in tone was its reaction to the bungled iOS 6 Maps app .","The new Maps app crafted in-house by Apple to replace Google Maps on iPhones and iPads was riddled with flaws , from missing features to misplaced businesses , landmarks and even towns .","A week after the phone hit stores , Cook apologized for the map publicly and , with surprising humility , even pointed customers to competing products .","Some pundits compared his swift and contrite reaction to a terse and rare public apology from Jobs more than a month after complaints over the iPhone 4 's antenna erupted in 2010 .","Who is the next Steve Jobs ( and is there one ) ?","Cook 's mea culpa is just the latest demonstration of how he , and by extension Apple , is different from Jobs and the Jobs era at the company .","Cook comes off as having a far more relaxed and approachable personality , and he is less inclined to be the center of attention .","His product announcements are not one-man shows , but presentations shared with other Apple executives .","He is still discovering his own style -- a tricky undertaking given the abnormal amounts of scrutiny that follow Apple 's every move .","A recent article by Bloomberg Businessweek , citing interviews with current and former Apple executives , employees and partners , states \" the company is happier and even somewhat more transparent than it was during Jobs ' tenure ...","There are fewer frantic calls at midnight , and there 's less implicit pressure on engineers to cut short or cancel vacations in the heat of product development cycles . \"","Cook recently announced that most Apple employees at company headquarters will get the week of Thanksgiving off with pay , according to reports .","Unfortunately for Apple 's soft-spoken chief executive , he has been incessantly compared to his predecessor after every presentation , successes and failures .","\" To simply put Steve Jobs on some sort of pedestal and say Apple could do no wrong under Steve 's leadership is wrong , \" said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg .","Remember Ping , Apple 's failed attempt at a social network centered around music ?","Cook has not launched any bold new products in the past 12 months .","So far , the company has only released minor updates of popular products , like speedier laptops , the new Mac operating system , the refreshed iPod line and the new , taller iPhone 5 .","They 've all been met with solid reviews ( Maps app aside ) and sold well .","Apple has gone on to become the most valuable company in history .","A year ago on October 4 , Apple stock closed at $ 381.80 a share .","On Wednesday , it closed at $ 671.45 .","But by staying the course , Cook has raised some concerns that he may lack the imagination and the bold ability to conjure up mind-blowing new products , which was Jobs ' hallmark .","Cook 's last major responsibility was decidedly left-brained : streamlining Apple 's supply chain .","Some question how much credit for Apple 's recent financial success should go Cook and how much is residual carryover from Jobs ' regime .","He prepared the company and its executives to carry on his vision and spent years grooming staff and setting up Apple to continue on seamlessly without him .","Is it any surprise that it 's continued to do so well ?","Your thoughts on the next Steve Jobs .","Gartenberg says that while Jobs gave the appearance of being entirely in control , he did not in fact design each new device single-handedly .","Apple has about 12,000 employees in the United States , not counting retail and support staff .","It is a large , well-oiled machine that knows how to design and sell beautiful

end of a model 's life cycle .","\" Apple has a huge amount of good will among consumers .","They 've started eating away at that , \" said Kuittinen , referring to the Map app problems .","Kuittinen believes the big decisions that will define Cook are still yet to come .","Some are decisions Jobs never made , such as whether to drop the price of the iPhone to be competitive in emerging markets .","Cook has already proven that he is aggressive about international sales .","The iPhone 5 will be in 100 countries at the end of this year -- a far speedier and more expansive roll out than previous Apple devices .","It 's still too early for anyone to predict Cook 's long-term success or failure , observers say .","And the true impact of Jobs ' absence wo n't be known for two years or

much about violence .","Right before he took office , Pena Nieto began a trip to the United States in November saying that ties between the neighboring nations must go beyond the drug war .","In

they wo n't parade recently arrested criminals in front of the cameras . \"","That 's a marked change from his predecessor , Calderon , who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006 .","The war on drugs became a hallmark of his presidency , and the death toll from drug-related violence during his tenure had soared to more than 47,500 when the government stopped releasing updated figures in early 2012 -- his last year in office .","In farewell speeches , Calderon noted that 25 of Mexico 's 37 most wanted criminals had been apprehended on his watch .","\" The

Grayson , who studied Mexico 's ruthless Zetas cartel for his 2012 book \" The Executioner 's Men . \"","\" You do n't want to talk about your crazy aunt in the attic . ...","They want to shift the narrative , \" he said .","On the campaign trail last year , Pena Nieto vowed to reduce violence and said he 'd take a different tack -- an election promise that played well with voters in a country weary of a drug war with a growing body count .","But two months into his six-year presidency , analysts say it 's still unclear how he 'll accomplish that goal .","\" What he wants to crack down on are kidnappings , extortion , what 's more likely to affect average people .","There 's been no secret that he wants to move in that direction and use more of a scalpel than a broad sword in combating the cartels , \" Grayson said , \" and he seems to have sent a subliminal message to the cartels saying that if you just conduct your business and do n't disturb civilians , we 're not going to ignore you , but you 're not a top priority . \"","Pena Nieto has stressed that fixing social and economic problems will foster peace in Mexico , and he 's made some security policy shifts .","He started his term by eliminating the public safety ministry and placing the federal police it once controlled under the interior ministry 's power .","He 's also discussed a plan to divide the country into regions to tackle security problems and to create a new national gendarmerie force , which could eventually send Mexico 's military out of the streets and back into their barracks .","But the time frame for those changes is uncertain .","And in the meantime , discussing violence less does n't make the longstanding systemic problems fueling it go away , Chabat said .","\" It is important for any government to talk about other topics , like the economy .","But you ca n't negate what is happening , what people are still experiencing , \" he said .","` We are left with no other choice '","In some areas of Mexico , residents are tired of waiting for the government to step in to solve their problems .","\" What we are seeing in a lot of parts of the country is a vacuum of the state ... and the proliferation of private security corps , of paramilitary groups , \" Chabat said .","Incidents like the tourist attack in Guerrero will only do more to promote that approach , Chabat said , noting that it raises worrying concerns about abuses by vigilantes taking the law into their own hands .","\" The government is overcome . ...","That 's the tragedy , \" he said .","\" There is no short-term solution . \"","As word of this week 's rape allegations in Acapulco spread , a group of people in one nearby neighborhood took a vote on Tuesday .","If local , state and federal officials ca n't track down and apprehend those responsible , they decided they 'll take matters into their own hands .","\" We are going to have to rise up with weapons .","...","We can not wait until they keep destroying the port of Acapulco with these kinds of incidents , \" said Sergio Mejia , president of a 35-member association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco 's Bonfil beach community .","\" We think the government is very timid , very slow .","If there is no immediate response , it leaves us no choice but to join the fight and set up checkpoints on the street corners . \"","Months ago , he read about other groups in the region taking similar steps , forming paramilitary self-defense groups of masked men that patrol the streets .","At first , it seemed extreme .","Now , it sounds sensible , he said .","In this area where the economy relies on tourism , he said , residents are tired of waiting for authorities to take action .","But it 's not just that a high-profile crime targeting tourists is bad for business .","\" Today they were foreigners , \" said Mejia , who owns a restaurant that specializes in serving up freshly caught seafood .","\" Tomorrow it could be our families . \"","Guerrero is named for a military general who fought for Mexico 's independence from Spain .","It 's also the Spanish word for warrior .","If the government ca n't protect them , Mejia says it 's time for the state 's residents to fight back .","More : Town takes justice into their own hands .","CNN 's Miguel Marquez , Nick Parker and David Ariosto and CNNMexico.com 's Nadia Sanders contributed to this report ."],"labels":[0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"summary":["A high-profile case in a violence-plagued Mexican state draws worldwide attention .","The alleged rape of six Spanish tourists in Acapulco casts a spotlight on violence .","Experts : Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has been trying to change perceptions .","Based on official figures , violence may be declining nationwide but spiking in some areas ."]}

your hand three inches from your face and not see it .","The silence is so complete that the low thud of snow falling from a nearby tree","makes you jump .","Your eyelashes are close to frozen","and it 's a struggle to separate them when you blink .","And yet you 'd happily sit there all night , for many nights to come , for the chance to see nature 's most mysterious sight : the northern lights .","Lonely Planet :","The world 's hottest cool places .","With little light pollution , optimum weather conditions ( very cold , with plenty of clear nights ) and its position directly beneath the prime-viewing zone of the auroral oval , Churchill in Canada is one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights .","The Arctic tundra and boreal forest surrounding the town see over 300 nights of auroral activity each year .","Displays might last hours , or be gone in a minute .","Flashing neon pink , turquoise and green , the lights swirl across the sky in myriad imagined shapes ( is that a walrus , a witch , a whale ? )","before whipping back on themselves and disappearing .","In the presence of such a spectacle , it 's easy to believe local Inuit myth that the aurora borealis are signals from the afterlife , particularly if you hear the sky crackle and swoosh as some claim .","What is in no doubt during those moments when the lights whirl above your head is that you 're part of the greatest show on earth .","2 .","Icebound St Petersburg .","January in St Petersburg .","The city 's residents , long used to the cold , don fur hats and heavy coats to stand in line .","Nowadays , they wait not for bread , but for art : frozen art .","Every winter , sculptors transform blocks of ice into elaborate models of people , animals and objects .","It 's a tradition that dates back to 1740 , when an entire ice palace was constructed to celebrate the birthday of the Empress Anna .","Set against a backdrop of golden domes sparkling in the light of the low sun , the exhibit embodies the magic of St Petersburg in winter .","Locals bypass the city 's bridges , slithering over the ice-covered rivers and canals to make their way across town .","The Neva River is frozen solid , except for one large hole in front of the Peter Paul Fortress .","This is the plunge pool for the Walrus Club , a group of swimmers who exhort the health benefits of a daily dip .","When the cold finally seeps in , Petersburgers warm up with a vodka , served in an ice glass , from the ice bar .","\" At least we can do something with all this ice other than slipping and falling on it ! \"","observes one happy patron .","3 .","Sweden 's reindeer migration .","One of the world 's greatest migrations takes place each year just over a thousand miles north of Britain .","As snow thickens on every surface , lakes freeze over and the temperature drops below -25 \u00cb\u0161C , tens of thousands of reindeer make their way across northern Sweden .","Descending from summer pastures in the mountains to the west , the herds travel east to spend the long winter foraging in the forests .","Accompanying them on a journey that can take ten days or more are their seminomadic Sami owners .","While herding methods may have modernized over the centuries ( snowmobiles -- and even helicopters -- have replaced snowshoes ) , reindeer husbandry is still a cornerstone

nights sharing stories round the fire under a chill , star-filled sky .","Lonely Planet :","The UK 's favorite winter pubs .","4 .","Italy 's sunken bell .","Head to Italy 's South Tyrol this winter","and you 're likely to come across one of Europe 's most bizarre sights -- an apparently amputated church spire poking out from the frozen waters of Lago di Resia .","The 14th-century bell tower , pointing like an arrow to the blustery skies above , is a forlorn monument to an entire village drowned beneath the waters of an artificial lake created as part of a hydroelectricity project in the 1950s .","Locals will tell you that the tolling of its church bell can still be heard on a cold night -- even though the bell was removed when the valley was flooded .","Tall tales may have sprung up around it , but the church and the lake are very much part of local life , particularly in winter .","Snow-kiters twirl across the ice , leaping high into the air as their kites catch a gust of wind , keeping an eye out for ice-skaters gliding around the lake 's perimeter .","Families slip and slide their way to the base of the tower , eager to slap their gloved hands on a piece of history that 's out of reach most of the year .","5 .","Yellowstone 's boiling waters .","There are few places as beguiling as Yellowstone National Park .","It is a landscape created by grinding glaciers and volcanic eruptions , a place of fire and brimstone where the very earth breathes , belches and bubbles like a giant kettle on the boil .","Here , in a land roamed by moose , bears and wolves , geysers and hot springs seethe and simmer and finally blow , capturing the imagination as they have done since the park 's inception in 1872 .","It is America made wild and primeval .","As the temperature drops and the snow piles high , the park takes on a special drama and grace .","The tourist crowds thin , replaced by cross-country skiers silently swooshing along marked trails .","Shaggy-coated bison pick their way through the deep snow to warm themselves in geyser basins , waiting for a waft of hot stream from shimmering thermal pools .","They retreat a few paces as a hot spring suddenly erupts , sending an arc of boiling water high into the frigid air .","6 .","Korea 's ice festivals .","For much of the year , the sancheoneo -- a species of trout -- leads a blameless life in the rivers around Hwacheon , a town that lies in the mountains northeast of Seoul .","When the cold , dry Korean winter arrives , the rivers freeze over and the sancheoneo disappear under 40cm of ice .","And then the trouble starts .","Every January , the Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival brings a sudden energy to this quiet corner of the country .","Hundreds of thousands of thickly clad visitors swarm over every frozen surface to try their hand at ice-fishing .","Barbecues come as naturally to Koreans as baguettes to the French , and the smell of charcoal fires wafts along the banks , ready for the latest catch .","For a few visitors , dropping a line through a hole in the ice to catch their fish is just not enough of an experience .","Dressed in T-shirts and shorts , they plunge into a pool of near freezing water and learn just what slippery customers trout can be .","7 .","Snowbound London .","Ten o'clock on a Monday morning in central London .","No buses steam down

said Eugene Spafford , a computer security specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies .","Cyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis .","Last year , antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined .","In the United States , the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year .","Companies lost an average of $ 4.6 million in intellectual property last year , according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee .","\" As the economy has declined , we 've seen the threat landscape increase , \" David DeWalt , president and CEO of McAfee , recently told Richard Quest for CNN International 's \" Quest Means Business . \"","That increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company 's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year .","But companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals , experts say .","\" The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains , \" said Michael Fraser , director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia .","\" They have R&D departments , strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal , \" Fraser said .","On these Web sites , would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own \" botnet \" -- referring to software that can , unbeknownst to victims , turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks .","One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $ 500 -- discounted to $ 400 for the first 100 buyers .","Skimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites , Fraser said .","\" When police shut these Web sites down , they just mushroom up

threats include \" phishing \" schemes and \" botnet \" attacks .","Phishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords , credit card information and other personal data .","Botnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of \" zombie \" computers that , on command , target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities .","Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes .","\" They ring up the IT manager of a company and say , ` Pay us a million or we 'll take you down ' , \" said Fraser , who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks .","Companies often pay up and shut up , computer experts say , rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation .","And unlike prankster virus-makers , these malware makers are determined to stay hidden .","\" Once it became a business , then ( cyber criminals ) began to look at what companies like us were doing , and figure out weaknesses , \" he said .","\" They are very customer friendly ...","they sell updates , they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software ca n't detect them .","Adding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions , it is not illegal to create or sell malware .","\" It 's like the arms industry ...","it 's not a crime to build and sell them , \" Negi said .","And because of the transnational nature of the crime , it 's extremely difficult to prosecute .","A scan of 500 headlines on Internet-related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child-pornography cases .","\" Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator 's computer systems , \" said Spafford of Purdue University .","Cyber-criminal networks are as

may be able to trace back to a computer system , if I 'm lucky , or trace it back to a cyber cafe -- but how do I know who was behind it ? \"","Often criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China , where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country , Spafford said .","\" For the host countries , that 's dangerous ... it 's kind of like breeding tigers in the back yard and saying , ` Well , they have n't hurt anyone here yet",", ' \" he said .","\" Mexico is a wonderful example ... they tolerated drug

.","Nearly one year ago , a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off Japan 's central Pacific coast , triggering a devastating tsunami and aftershocks that left more than 15,700 dead , according to a government report in December on Japan 's recovery from the catastrophe .","About 4,500 were listed as missing .","Nearly 700 aftershocks registering magnitude 5 or greater followed last year 's quake , the government report said .","The March 11 earthquake -- dubbed \" Tohoku \" after the region in which it occurred -- also damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station , where three reactors experienced full meltdowns , creating a nuclear crisis for a country already grappling with disaster .","The research institute cited for its findings the Gutenberg Richter Law , which states that an increase in small tremors will likely increase the number of larger earthquakes .","According to another paper published in September , the institute concluded that the quake ruptured a fault area nearly 500 kilometers in length and 200 kilometers wide offshore .","The fourth strongest quake recorded in history , Tohoku caused abrupt stress changes in the upper plate and triggered widespread seismic activity throughout the Japanese island .","The northern part of Ibaraki Prefecture , in particular , saw a significant increase of shallow seismicity after the quake compared with the extremely low rate eight years prior , the researchers said .","Should Tokyo 's inhabitants be worried ?","The research institute 's findings carry great consequences for the 42 million people who live in the Tokyo metropolitan area .","The Central Disaster Management Council has estimated that a large-scale earthquake in the next few decades could result in 11,000 deaths and an economic loss of 112 trillion yen ( US$ 1.5 trillion ) .","Its goal is to halve the estimated death toll and reduce the estimated economic loss .","How precise are seismic forecasts ?","Gary Gibson , a seismologist at Australia 's Seismology Research Centre , called the Earthquake Research Institute 's findings \" not at all unexpected , \" given the level of seismic activity and their model .","\" Seismologists can not predict with certainty when , where and how large the next big earthquake will be , \" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN . \"","However , it is possible to forecast the probability of an earthquake in a particular time range ( e.g. the next four years ) , location area ( e.g. the Tokyo region ) , and magnitude range ( e.g. greater than magnitude 7.0 ) .","\" Long-term forecasts use average activity levels from all known past earthquakes , geological data from fault displacements , and data about plate movement and deformation from very precise GPS measurements and other methods to determine these probabilities . \"","What is the government saying ?","The government 's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion had put a 70 % probability of a magnitude-7 quake in Kanto region , which encompasses Tokyo and Yokohama , within 30 years , based on long-term seismicity and hazard studies .","Scientists have already dubbed as \" Tokai \" an expected 8.0 quake near Suruga Bay , where large quakes have historically struck every 100-150 years , according to the Japan Meteorological Agency .","The last one , a magnitude-8 .4 quake , occurred in 1854 -- nearly 160 years ago .","According to Gibson , the seismologist , the enhanced seismicity in the area affected by the Tohoku quake may fall towards normal levels and could affect the research institute 's findings .","Results for the six-month period after the quake would become available after this coming March 11 , the quake 's anniversary , he noted .","Why is Japan so prone to earthquakes ?","The Japanese archipelago and neighboring areas rest on or around four tectonic plates -- the Pacific , Philippine Sea ,","North American and Eurasian plates -- whose movements account for one of the most seismically active places on earth .","Can Tokyo withstand a 7.0 quake ?","Gibson said that while the area is a very active one seismically , building standards are high , therefore reducing the damage caused by earthquakes .","Buildings in Tokyo held up well in the face of the \" Tohoku \" quake .","Reinforced concrete and anti-seismic systems in buildings are among features that have helped absorb shocks when earthquakes occur .","Watch Tokyo 's quake-proof communities .","\" A magnitude 7.0 earthquake is very much smaller than the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake , \" he wrote .","\" It would need 1,000 magnitude-7 .0 earthquakes to release as much strain energy as the magnitude 9.0 .","The fault rupture size is tens of kilometers , rather than hundreds of kilometers , and the fault

{"story":["( CNN ) --","While the visiting national news media focuses on the latest utterances of Republican presidential hopefuls in advance of the January 3 caucuses , many Iowans have found a bone to pick with a journalism professor -- from the University of Iowa , no less -- who wrote : \" Whether a schizophrenic , economically depressed , and some say , culturally challenged state like Iowa should host the first grassroots referendum to determine who will be the next president is n't at issue . ...","In a perfect world , no way would Iowa ever be considered representative of America , or even a small part of it .","Iowa 's not representative of much . \"","Iowans are wondering what they did to incur the wrath of Stephen G.

. \"","It may be a good thing that Bloom , a native of New Jersey , has been away teaching this semester at the University of Michigan because in trying to explain \" in both a real and metaphysical way , what Iowa is , \" he has drawn the ire of Iowans literally from all corners of the state -- from Sibley and Keokuk ( whose mayor has invited him to visit and explain the \" a depressed , crime-infested slum town \" remark ) to Decorah to Shenandoah .","In the interest of full disclosure , many of my childhood vacations ( including winter ) were spent visiting my mother 's parents in Iowa .","I graduated from a college in Iowa , and my first full-time job in journalism was at a newspaper in Iowa , so I admit to a certain fondness for the state .","And every four years , as the political spotlight shines on Iowa , I share with colleagues whatever helpful insights I can muster .","Blitzer 's blog : Turbulence in Iowa .","The state is not one large cornfield , but driving along Interstate 80 , it can appear that way for long stretches .","Visit northeast Iowa along the Mississippi River for proof that the state is not flat .","Iowa 's farms not only help feed the United States , but also much of the world , connecting this piece of \" flyover country \" to a global view .","Still , economists report that agriculture only accounts for roughly one in five jobs in the state .","Iowans may be older ( the average age continues to increase ) , whiter and more rural than the United States in general , but its Latino population is increasing and more of its residents are moving to urban areas .","Iowa boasts being among the most literate states in the union ( though some years ago state officials abandoned a plan to make \" Iowa : A State of Minds \" its license plate slogan ) .","Politically , over the years Iowans have elected some of the most liberal and some of the most conservative members of Congress .","Critics cite numerous examples of a snide tone in Bloom 's writing .","Consider his assessment of employment prospects in rural Iowa :","\" Those who stay in rural Iowa are often the elderly waiting to die , those too timid ( or lacking in educated ) to peer around the bend for better opportunities , an assortment of waste-toids and meth addicts with pale skin and rotted teeth , or those who quixotically believe , like Little Orphan Annie , that the sun 'll come out tomorrow . \"","What makes Iowa 's GOP caucuses unique .","And while they wait for that sun to come out , Bloom suggests , these Iowans spend their days stepping in manure from barnyard animals and stuffing their gullets with meat loaf , pork chops and Jell-O molds before heading out to a tractor pull or church .","Bloom makes nary a mention of the distinguished academics at the state 's universities and colleges , its art museums and orchestras nor even the obvious upgrades to the capital city of Des Moines during the past 20 years .","Where he says that \" Iowa is a throwback to yesteryear and , at the same time , a cautionary tale of what lies around the corner , \" critics find many of Bloom 's observations to be throwbacks to an Iowa that no longer exists .","Many also say there are factual inaccuracies in the article .","Sally Mason , president of the University of Iowa , which employs Bloom , objected .","\" I disagree strongly with and was

and wide across this great state frequently , and the Iowa I see is one of strong , hard-working and creative people .","In this cynical world that can harden even the greatest optimist , the citizens of Iowa continue to believe , \" Mason responded to The Atlantic .","\" What defines Iowans are their deeds and actions and not some caricature .","When I travel the state , what I see is a land that is rich not only because of its soil but because of how its people are grounded .","Iowans are pragmatic and balanced , and they live within their means .","This lifestyle , while not glitzy , is humble and true and can weather the most difficult of times , \" Mason said .","Sports editor Pete Temple of the Monticello Express newspaper agreed with some parts of Bloom 's article , but suggested that \" rather than having some good-natured fun with the quirks and traditions that make rural Iowa life so unique , Bloom 's tone is condescending , apparently designed to mock rural Iowa in front of the rest of the nation . \"","Bloom , he wrote , \" fails to mention one of rural Iowa 's greatest qualities , which is its ability to rise up and come together for someone in need .","You have farmers completing a harvest for a neighbor , fund-raisers for families of ill or injured residents , and citizens filling sandbags to ward against an impending flood .","Rural Iowans do these things willingly , immediately , and without question .","If that 's not representative of our nation as a whole , that 's a shame . \"","Dean Klinkenberg , who writes about life along the Mississippi River , offered this scathing assessment : \" Bloom wrote a poorly reasoned article plagued by factual errors and loaded with big-city stereotypes of country folk .","His essay was , ultimately , a lazy piece of incendiary rubbish , which I guess is what passes for journalism today . \"","Bloom shared some of his \" fan mail \" with media commentator Jim Romanesko , including this excerpt : \" First I want to apologize for Iowans who may have threatened you .","I am a dental student here at the university and grew up in a small Iowa town my whole life ( Palo ) before coming here .","I agree that we have our problems as Iowans but one thing we are is fiercely loyal .","Your article is true ( for the most part ) about rural Iowans but anyone from here , esp us city folk , are going to be upset by that stereotype . \"","Bloom defended his work in a letter to the Press-Citizen newspaper in Iowa City .","\" Perhaps my article gave some Iowans a moment to refocus their attention elsewhere -- from some of the real issues confronting the state -- Walmart taking over the retail-trade sector , empty storefronts , water pollution among the worst in the nation , factories shutting down , the

defeat at the hands of Germany in the 2010 World Cup finals -- have put immense pressure on the national team to perform well in the Copa America tournament they currently host .","There is no doubt that the tournament is being staged on the back of a traumatic few months for Argentine football .","Serious crowd disorder , chronic financial problems , the continued drain of top talent to rich European clubs and the shock relegation of the mighty River Plate have all combined to leave many fans with furrowed brows .","Add to this the apparent strength of traditional rivals Brazil , who have just won the Copa Libertadores -- the biggest club prize in South American football -- with Santos , and whose teams are managing to keep hold of their better players due to an improved national

{"story":["( CNN ) --","After two years of debate , the constitutional challenges to President Barack Obama 's health care law finally reached the U.S. Supreme Court this week .","While the intensity of the debate suggests the law is vulnerable to being overturned , 70 years of judicial precedents provide strong grounds for upholding the law .","On Monday , the opening day of oral arguments did little to address the core constitutional questions .","Rather , the nine justices were asked to consider whether an arcane rule of tax law would require the court to postpone its decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate to purchase health care .","Under a federal statute , people can not challenge a tax until the Internal Revenue Service tries to collect it .","According to this line of reasoning , people who object to the individual mandate are objecting to the tax that they will have to pay if they do not purchase insurance .","Since no one will have to pay a penalty until 2015 , one of the courts of appeals had dismissed the constitutional challenge .","However , there was little sentiment among the justices to postpone a decision until 2015 .","The only real uncertainty is how they will explain why the appellate court was wrong .","Is it because the penalty for not purchasing insurance is not a \" tax \" ?","Is it because the government wants the case to go forward and can permit people to challenge a tax even before it is imposed ?","There 's another tax argument that the court is likely to reject based on clues given on the first day .","The government is claiming that the individual mandate is authorized by the power of Congress to tax Americans .","The justices seemed skeptical about this point .","Justice Stephen Breyer , for example , expressed doubt that the penalty for not purchasing insurance could be viewed as a tax .","And none of the lower courts have bought the taxing power argument .","On Day Two , the government 's more

statements , the four liberal-leaning justices on the court are expected to agree .","Legal experts therefore will pay close attention to the questions asked by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia for signs on their views about the commerce power .","Critics of the health care law say the commerce power allows Congress to regulate people who are voluntarily engaged in economic transactions , but Congress can not require people to buy a good or service solely because they are living in the United States .","The government will respond that under the new health care law , insurers no longer will be able to deny people affordable coverage because they have had a heart attack , cancer diagnosis or other medical problem .","Starting in 2014 , \" pre-existing medical conditions \" can not serve as a basis for raising premiums or refusing to offer insurance .","And there is no question that the commerce power permits this new rule .","But there is a cost to protecting the public from pre-existing conditions fees .","Insurers can be asked to charge the same rates for everyone only if the public is required to purchase coverage .","Otherwise , many people would wait until they suffer an illness or injury to buy their policy .","In other words , the individual mandate is simply designed to prevent freeloading that would cause the pre-existing conditions provision to fail , and the Constitution gives Congress the power to make sure its laws can be implemented effectively .","For argument , the government will cite the court 's medical marijuana decision , and it will be interesting to see how Scalia discusses his position in that case .","There , he sided with the majority in recognizing a broad federal power to regulate commerce , even when an individual is cultivating marijuana for personal medical use and not for any commercial purposes .","If Congress can apply its drug laws to someone not engaged in any

{"story":["Giglio , Italy ( CNN ) -- Father Lorenzo Pasquotti keeps hundreds of cards and letters from the passengers and crew members who survived the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise liner on a shelf in the rectory of the brick-faced Church of the Madonna of Giglio , just up the narrow street from the island 's only port .","Many of the letters , handwritten in English , German , French and Italian , are addressed simply to \" Giglio , Italy 58012 \" to no one in particular , almost as if the island itself is a person .","The writers express gratitude for assistance they received or apologize for the wreck 's impact on Giglio .","When the postal carrier brings the mail over on the morning ferry from the Italian mainland , he either leaves the new letters with Mayor Sergio Ortelli or at the church with Father Pasquotti .","After all , Giglio has always been the type of place where the mailman knows exactly who is around and who is not .","INTERACTIVE : How the 952-foot wreck will be raised .","At least that 's the way it used to be before the Costa Concordia ran aground off Giglio on January 13 , 2012 , killing 32 passengers and injuring dozens more .","But in the last year since the salvage operation began at full tilt , the island has shifted from being a secluded utopia that attracted mainly birdwatchers hoping to spot Corsican seagulls , kestrals and goldcrests , or hikers who wanted to climb its solitary slopes , to what it is now : the epicenter of the largest-ever maritime salvage operation in the world .","The island has a winter population of around 1,000 people spread between the port , the village of Castello on top of the island 's hill , and the seaside village of Campese on the other side .","The population swells considerably during the summer months when hotels and seaside resorts are brimming with sun seekers .","But now Giglio 's permanent population has been bolstered by a constant crew of at least 500 Titan Salvage and Micoperi workers from 21 nations who have , in many ways , invaded paradise .","Many live offshore in a floating dormitory called the Discovery , but they all make their way to the island on a regular basis .","A scant few of the new Giglese , as the island 's inhabitants are called , are pale engineers , who , despite being on a sunny island for more than a year , still have n't managed a tan .","They spend their time in simulated control rooms behind computer screens , working out every potential obstacle in tipping the massive cruise liner , which ran aground off the island in January 2012 , to an upright position .","One such worker is Jan Walhout , a Dutch engineer who will be one of the eight people in the control room when the Concordia is rotated upright in a delicate procedure called \" parbuckling \" that is scheduled to take place September 16 .","He lives in an apartment in the port and not on the Discovery , but he still has seen very little of the island .","That 's not why he 's here .","\" I am here for a job , \" Walhout told CNN inside a simulated control room attached to the Bahama 's Hotel next to Pasquotti 's church .","\" I know a lot of people on the team who socialize in town , but I am here to concentrate on this job . \"","The rest of the temporary crew are mostly contracted shift workers who learned their perilous trade in places like west Texas and the British midlands .","Salvage jobs are a natural leap for skilled deep-sea drillers and rig constructors looking for lucrative seasonal work , and many of them have taken up with the local girls , completely transforming the social scene at the port .","On any given night of the week , the portside bars are filled with men in gray Titan Salvage jumpsuits .","An occasional salvage woman joins the mix , but the vast majority are men who come in to port to unwind .","Some wear holsters with scissors hanging on them -- a cowboy-esque equivalent of a pistol for deep sea oilrig divers .","Others sling their red inflatable Titan-Micoperi life vests over their shoulders or dangle them on the barstools .","People are still talking about the night last June when a life vest inflated spontaneously inside the Bar Monti , one of the most popular hangouts for the salvage crew .","Matteo Di Mariuz , who runs the popular hangout , does n't mind the new clientele .","Sure he has had to introduce country music and imported beer for the new crowds , but he takes it all in stride .","\" They are hard workers who work long hours to move that monster from our waters , \" he told CNN .","\" They deserve a little down time . \"","Mariuz , who took over the bar from his parents two years ago , now stays open during the winter weeknights , something his parents could rarely afford to do because Giglio just did n't produce enough customers .","In the morning he , like most of the coffee bars along the port , will serve up American breakfast on request .","They 've also learned what it takes to make a good cup of tea .","All along the port , cafes and bakeries have adapted to the newcomers , some even mastering the art of making BLT 's and sarnies for the workers ' packed lunches .","And even after the Concordia is rotated , the crews will have a lot of work to do to fix the starboard side and refloat the ship sometime next summer , meaning Giglio wo n't be going to normal any time soon .","Most of the restaurateurs and business owners across the island hold nothing against the salvage crews who they feel are the only hope for getting rid of the rotting vessel .","Despite an obvious decline in tourism , there is a definite increase in steady customers , especially during the winter months when , prior to the shipwreck , Giglio was a ghost island .","Franca Melis , who owns a small enoteca called La Galera in Castello on the top of the island 's hill and a dive shop down in the port , says it is hypocritical for islanders to complain that the Concordia has ruined their livelihood -- especially in the port .","The economic slump surely has as much to do with a drop in tourists , and anyway , even in good years people were never able to rent their properties year round like they do now to the salvage workers .","She even sees a silver lining .","She is lobbying other islanders to push to keep the massive platforms Titan-Micoperi installed to stabilize the ship even after the Concordia is towed away .","\" It would give us one of the best dive schools in the world , \" she told CNN .","\" We ca n't rewind the clock and pretend none of this happened , instead we have to look at ways to make it work for the island 's vitality . \"","Melis has been a strong voice both to the media and at the islanders ' monthly meetings with the salvage managers , environmental experts and Franco Gabrielli , the government 's commissioner for the Costa Concordia disaster .","She agrees that now , when the removal of the ship is a top priority , may not be the best time to bring up life post-Concordia , but she wants people to start thinking about the future again .","Plus , she points out that it could take up to two more years for workers to remove all the salvage implements they 've put in place , all the while the port views will be marred with cranes and rigs .","\"","Leave them , \" she says .","\" They offer far more good than harm . \"","The tragedy has not exactly united the islanders .","In some ways , it has created two camps -- those that see an economic advantage to the twist of fate and those who count the days until every trace of the ship is gone .","It is not difficult to envision tense days ahead .","Melis 's main opposition to keeping the platforms is the island 's headstrong mayor Sergio Ortelli , who wants Costa Crociere to keep its promise to return his island to exactly the way it was before anyone had ever heard of the Costa Concordia -- and that means both above and below the waterline .","Ortelli has a perfect view of the operation from his office window in the port and high-resolution diagrams of every stage of the parbuckling project on his computer , which he is happy to show on an overhead monitor to anyone who asks .","He keeps track of the salvage schedule , logging days they 've lost to bad weather to make his own estimate about when the ship will finally be gone from his view .","\" We need our island back exactly way it was before that terrible day , \" he says .","He still recalls how many passengers slept in his office that fateful night , and he says he feels a personal responsibility to the islanders to hold Costa to its promise .","\" Everything must go , \" he says .","\" Not just the ship . \"","No matter what happens after the physical remains of the liner are gone , the islanders will never forget how their lives changed the night of Friday , the 13th of January , 2012 , when 4,200 people spilled into their quiet port .","Father Pasquotti estimates that more than a thousand of the Concordia 's passengers have come back to Giglio since the accident .","Many came to bring back the blankets and dry clothing that the islanders gave them the night of the disaster .","Merchants along the port 's main street usually know what belongs to whom by asking around .","Giglio still has the feel of a small town .","In some ways everything has changed on Giglio , but a few things still remain exactly the same .","Despite having one of the most technologically advanced salvage operations every attempted happening in the harbor , it is still impossible to buy an iPhone charger or camera battery anywhere on the island , or read the day 's newspapers until the 9:00 a.m. ferry docks -- if someone remembers to send them over from the mainland .","No one is

in Ferguson might be calmed if the government would simply release all the details of Michael Brown 's death , bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson if appropriate and hold accountable those officials who unleashed a military-style assault on protesting citizens .","Yet in another sense , the simmering anger that has bubbled over in Ferguson will never go away as long as the ugly conditions of racial bias in America go unaddressed .","On August 9 , a police officer in Ferguson shot and killed Brown , an unarmed , black 18-year-old boy .","Just days earlier , on August 5 ,

43-year-old black father of six on Staten Island , New York , in what has now been ruled a homicide .","These killings occurred against the backdrop of a long history of black men being suspiciously , recklessly , wantonly killed by police .","This is in addition to everyday harassment by police to which young black men have become sadly accustomed .","In New York in 2011 , 25 % of the NYPD 's stop and frisks targeted young black men , who make up less than 2 % of the city 's overall population .","In Ferguson last year , as Jeff Smith wrote in The New York Times , 86 % of police stops , 92 % of searches and 93 % of arrests were of black folks -- despite the documented fact that cops there were less likely to find contraband on black drivers than on whites ( for black drivers , it was 22 % compared with 34 % for whites ) .","It should n't need pointing out , but for the record , white people in America commit more crimes than black people .","But perhaps even more significant , as the historian David Levering Lewis has pointed out , is that \" whites committed crimes but blacks are criminals . \"","Despite the fact that the vast majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white males , we do n't condemn nor scrutinize white men nor white people as a group for the acts of these individuals .","And yet we ascribe the criminal behavior of individual black people to the black community as a whole .","In one study , subjects were shown a news story about a crime .","No photo of the alleged perpetrator was shown , but 60 % of the time subjects thought they had seen a

communities , especially black men and boys , must be understood not as an issue of rogue cops or isolated incidents but as an extreme manifestation of the sort of implicit racial bias that courses through every aspect of our nation .","In fact , cops who shoot unarmed black men have something in common with college students -- in video simulated research tests , both cops and college students ,

struggling in the face of racial bias have to endure the secondary injustice of having their experience and concerns dismissed , whether it 's politicians suggesting that poverty is a \" cultural problem \" in communities of color or media figures arguing that black men are disproportionately arrested and locked up because \" in certain ghetto neighborhoods , it 's part of the culture . \"","But the fact is that while white people use drugs more , black folks are more likely to be arrested for and face higher sentences for drug use .","Blaming these and other egregious discrepancies

the Tenant of Wildfell Hall are literary classics set against the backdrop of the wild and windswept moors that surround their birthplace in the West Riding .","Local organizers are banking that the worldwide appeal of the Tour will showcase the history and heritage of their region -- dubbed \" God 's own county \" by locals -- and attract new tourism .","If the huge crowds which greeted the last visit of Le Grand Boucle to Britain in 2007 are anything to go by , that is pretty much guaranteed .","All over Yorkshire , Haworth included , towns and cities on the route are bedecked with welcoming signs and references to the unique magic of a race which started in 1903 with the aim of boosting the circulation of a French newspaper L'Auto and has grown to become the biggest spectator event in the sporting calendar .","\" The race has excited the public and cycling community and is the biggest sporting event to take place anywhere in the UK in 2014 , \" said Larry Hickmott , the editor of the website VeloUK.net and a veteran observer of the British cycling scene .","Over a million people are expected to line the roads for the two stages in Yorkshire and the third from Cambridge to the British capital London , before the race heads to its traditional home in France for the remaining 18 stages .","The pre-race buildup has been dominated by a row over the decision to leave Britain 's most famous cyclist , Bradley Wiggins , out of the Team Sky lineup .","Wiggins made history when he won the 2012 edition of the Tour before going on to claim Olympic gold a week later at the London Games .","With his trademark sideburns and ` Mod ' fashion sense , Wiggins assumed cult status and became a national hero , but his ongoing rivalry with fellow Team Sky member Chris Froome has since taken on the sort of brooding intrigue which would not have been out of place in a Bronte novel .","Froome , who had been his right hand man in helping Wiggins win the 2012 Tour , still finishing a fine second , duly won last year 's race , with Wiggins absent after illness and crashes in an abortive attempt at claiming the preceding Giro d'Italia .","Wiggins might have been expected to return to the Team Sky squad this year , particularly with the race starting in Britain , but instead has been left on the sidelines .","His devoted fans believe Froome -- who has been quoted as calling his teammate \" mentally weak \" -- played a part in his exclusion , but this is denied by the Kenyan-born British rider .","\" Just to make it absolutely clear , I do not have a role in selection , \" Froome told gathered reporters ahead of the start .","Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford said the decision had \" kept him awake at night , but lauded the 29-year-old Froome as the \" the best stage race rider in the world . \"","Either way , while Froome and his eight teammates begin their quest to bring Team Sky a third straight yellow jersey , Wiggins will likely be training at the Manchester Velodrome ahead of riding the 4km individual and team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .","\" The most popular opinion is that Wiggins should ride , both from public and avid cycling fans and even many of ` informed ' inside the sport , \" said Hickmott , who has followed his career since he was a youngster .","But to understand while Wiggins -- who may well have been capable of finishing on the podium -- has been left out it is necessary to examine the dynamics of a cycling team in its approach to races like the Tour de France .","The entire Team Sky squad will act as \" domestiques \" or helpers for Froome , sacrificing their own chances to help him claim the yellow jersey in Paris .","At best , Wiggins would have been a \" super domestique \" -- which is a rider who might be expected to step up to the plate if a mishap or illness befell the team leader Froome .","Brailsford has given his role to Australian Richie Porte , hailing the Tasmanian as a \" Grand Tour winner of the future \" but has courted further controversy by leaving out young British stars Peter Kennaugh and Ben Swift , who finished first and second at their national championship last weekend .","With Swift omitted it will leave Team Sky without a recognized sprinter , the riders designated to contest the bunch finishes at the end of predominantly flat stages .","Despite its recent dominance of cycling at the Tour de France and in the Olympics , Britain will only have four competitors in this year 's race , but in Froome and sprint king Mark Cavendish ( Omega Pharma-Quick Step ) it has two jewels in the crown .","Cavendish , who has used his finishing speed to win 25 Tour de France stages , will be hoping his teammates can help him don the yellow jersey after the first stage which finishes in his mother 's home town of Harrogate .","Last year 's green jersey winner Peter Sagan of Slovakia and Germans Andre Greipel and Marcel Kittel will be his main challengers in these finishes -- with all looking to win the coveted final stage on the Champs Elysees in the French capital .","But the fastest men on two wheels are not contenders for the overall crown , usually losing time on the mountain stages and the individual time trials which decide that ultimate honor .","Froome has proved his worth in both those disciplines , winning the 2013 Tour by over four minutes from Nairo Quintana of the Movistar team .","Colombian Quintana won the Giro d'Italia earlier this year , but has decided against a tilt at the Tour , leaving two-time winner Alberto Contador as the likely

his ban , but impressive performances in 2014 serve notice of his abilities .","The 31-year-old always protested his innocence after failing a doping control for the banned stimulant Clenbuterol , but

{"story":["Austin , Texas ( CNN ) --","In February 2009 , Sam Bassett got called to Gov. Rick Perry 's office .","Bassett was then chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission , an agency set up in 2005 to regulate state crime labs after a series of embarrassing scandals .","The first matter on its plate involved the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham , whose murder conviction rested largely on testimony that many arson experts now call outdated and incorrect .","Aides to Perry , who allowed Willingham 's execution to go forward , started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission , a relatively new agency , Bassett said .","But then they started asking about Willingham , questioning whether the commission 's review of the evidence in his case was beyond its legal powers .","\" As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation , the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult , \" Bassett said .","About six months later , Bassett 's term on the commission was up -- and despite letters from members urging his reappointment , Perry replaced him and three other appointees .","The move came at what Bassett calls a \" critical point , \" two days before the commission was to hear from an expert who had delivered a scathing report on the Willingham case .","The governor 's new pick for chairman soon put the brakes on the investigation , raising some of the same questions about the commission 's authority that Bassett said Perry 's aides had .","And in July , with Perry gearing up for a run for president , the state 's attorney general delivered an opinion that appears to sharply limit the commission 's authority .","The Forensic Science Commission is meeting Thursday to decide what it can still do in light of that opinion .","For Bassett , an Austin defense lawyer , it 's the culmination of what he now calls a methodical campaign to shut down an investigation that might embarrass Perry .","\" At first , when I was replaced , I gave the governor the benefit of the doubt , \" he said .","\" But now that time has passed , I 've seen this kind of endless drumbeat of strategies and actions to stop this investigation , and it 's been terribly disappointing . \"","Perry 's campaign dismissed Bassett 's accusations Wednesday , repeating the governor 's characterization of Willingham as a \" monster \" who had sent his three young daughters to a fiery death .","\" The case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury , state and federal courts , the news media , anti-death penalty activists and the Forensic Science Commission , \" Perry spokesman Mark Miner told CNN in an e-mail .","\" Willingham was guilty of murdering his children . \"","The statement did not directly address Bassett 's accusations .","Bassett 's role in the matter ended in October 2009 .","He said Perry 's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the Willingham case .","He said a Perry aide thanked him for his service , but told him Perry \" wants to take the commission in a different direction . \"","Though the shakeup was controversial at the time , it was barely mentioned in Perry 's 2010 re-election campaign .","Perry is now seeking the Republican nomination for president , and Bassett says the Willingham case is a window into Perry 's leadership .","\" He 's not always open to any contradictory viewpoints that could actually be helpful , \" said Bassett , who describes himself as a Democratic-leaning supporter of capital punishment in some cases .","When the Willingham last-minute plea for a stay came before him ,","\" There was nobody at the helm to raise a flag and tell him , ` This is serious ...","this guy may have been convicted on faulty science , ' \" Bassett said .","Bassett said July 's opinion from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott \" provides Governor Perry with the cover he probably needs to totally squash the investigation . \"","Representatives of the attorney general 's office raised no concerns about the Forensic Science Commission 's jurisdiction when the panel voted unanimously to take on the Willingham investigation , he said .","The Corsicana man was put to death in February 2004 .","It was one of 234 executions Perry has overseen as the longest-serving U.S. governor and the head of the most death-penalty-friendly state .","Authorities in Corsicana say they remain convinced of Willingham 's guilt , arguing that other evidence beyond the now-challenged arson testimony supported his conviction .","The state fire marshal 's office has told the Forensic Science Commission it stands by the findings in his case .","Bassett said the commission was never looking into whether Willingham was innocent -- but he said much of the evidence cited in his trial is now considered \" junk science . \"","Perry 's campaign also noted that Willingham 's ex-wife now believes in his guilt .","And his state office told CNN that Willingham \" had full access to every level of the appeals process , and his conviction was consistently upheld . \"","\" His conviction was reviewed and upheld by multiple levels of state and federal courts , including nine federal courts -- four times by the U.S. Supreme Court alone over the course of more than a decade , \" deputy press secretary Lucy Nashed said in a written response to questions by CNN .","In Willingham 's case , Perry 's office says the governor was briefed on a last-minute filing by Austin-based fire science expert Gerald Hurst that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson , but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation .","Nashed told CNN that Hurst 's review of investigators ' findings in the Willingham fire was also reviewed by appeals courts and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles , which rebuffed a plea for clemency .","State and federal appeals courts \" agreed that the new opinion by Gerald Hurst was simply an opinion and did not merit reopening the case , \" she wrote .","Two subsequent reviews have backed up Hurst 's conclusions , finding that advances in the science of arson investigation since Willingham 's trial rendered obsolete most of the signs that fire marshals pointed to as evidence of arson in the case .","In the 1990s , researchers determined that several of the things cited in Willingham 's trial were likely to be produced in fully involved accidental fires .","The appearance of spider web-like cracks in panes of glass , once believed to have been the result of fires started with flammable liquids , turned out to be caused by the rapid cooling of windows sprayed with water .","Experiments conducted during that period showed burn patterns once thought to show multiple points of origin -- another possible indicator of arson -- also appear when the intense heat of even an accidental blaze radiates downward and sets items like furniture and carpet afire .","The most recent review was conducted by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler at the request of the Forensic Science Commission .","Beyler , then chairman of the International Association of Fire Safety Science , sharply criticized the testimony against Willingham and questioned whether it met even the standards of the day .","Beyler ultimately appeared before the commission in January 2011 , 15 months after he had been scheduled to answer questions about his report .","The commission began looking into Willingham 's conviction at the request of Willingham 's family and The Innocence Project , which works on behalf of inmates it believes are wrongly convicted .","The group has blasted Perry over his role in the issue , accusing him of trying to shut down the probe .","Stephen Saloom , the group 's policy director , told CNN that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson , some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science .","\" The Willingham

{"story":["( CNN )","-- Headlines and pundits once again declare that we have a crisis on our hands in the wake of discovering that North Korea is building a new nuclear reactor and a uranium enrichment plant .","More ominously , Tuesday brought news of direct artillery barrages between North and South Korea , heightening tensions and costing lives .","But as provocative and serious as this is , neither is a crisis .","Both fit a clear pattern of North Korean behavior -- a pattern that ultimately holds out the opportunity for progress .","Unfortunately , so far the U.S. response also fits a pattern of rhetorical condemnation but little in the way of creative or effective engagement .","Some key lessons need to be re-learned in light of these developments .","First , the fundamental security situation with respect to North Korea has not changed .","Pyongyang 's estimated stockpile of plutonium bombs remains the same ( four to eight bombs ' worth ) .","It does not have the capability to deliver these devices by aircraft or missile and its plutonium program remains frozen or perhaps even further eroded , as described in a report by Dr. Sig Hecker , who visited the North 's nuclear facilities two weeks ago .","Tuesday , in a briefing in Washington , Hecker , the former head of the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory , said that his report had been \" hyped \" in the media .","He detailed how the new facilities , while potentially capable of producing material for bombs , are hardly the quickest route for North Korea to do so .","Here 's why .","Uranium weapons are bigger than plutonium weapons , thus more difficult to shrink to the size needed for a missile warhead .","The facility Hecker visited could only produce one or two bombs ' worth of material a year , it is not clear when it will be fully operational and it has been built to replace the plutonium production facilities , not add to them .","The new , small light-water reactor under construction is actually not very good for producing weapons-grade plutonium .","If North Korea wanted to expand its nuclear arsenal , it makes much more sense for it to restart the plutonium reactor it has , not replace it with this new one .","Finally , the North Koreans said they would scrap their plutonium capabilities completely in exchange for improved relations with the United States .","In short , it is conceivable that the facilities are what the North claims , its attempt at home-grown nuclear energy , a goal the North has had for decades .","As Hecker said , the trip raised \" as many questions as it answered . \"","Second , as difficult as engagement is , it is preferable to the alternative , isolation and instability .","Remember that North Korea succeeded in acquiring or building these new facilities during a time when sanctions were extreme and U.S. engagement was absent .","In fact , we only know about the facilities because of an unofficial visit by Americans whom the North wanted to use to reveal them .","Before that , the Bush administration 's years-long policy of complete isolation allowed North Korea to produce plutonium , fashion it into bombs and test two of them .","Only in the last two years of the Bush era did a change in U.S. approach bear some fruit in freezing North Korea 's programs .","\" Strategic patience \" has been the nickname for the U.S. approach to North Korea since the early weeks of the Obama administration , when Pyongyang rejected early overtures of dialogue .","What the administration failed to grasp is that diplomacy with the North is pretty much the most difficult exercise one can do in international relations .","But that does not mean you should n't continue to try , even when -- or maybe especially when -- the response is a poke in the eye .","So where does this leave us ?","What can or should the United States do to respond to these latest developments ?","Here again , everything old is new again :","Creative , thoughtful approaches to engaging North Korea have to be designed and tested -- persistently .","Yes , U.S. overtures will annoy allies in the region , but not if done in concert with or through consultation with them .","Yes , the administration will suffer reactionary criticism from the right for \" dealing with evil \" or similar screeds .","But the stakes are too high to allow the long-term threats that North Korea poses to be hamstrung by near-term political scorekeeping .","President Obama has to be bold .","A number of ideas about how to proceed are offered in a recent piece by Lee Sigal of the Social Sciences Research Council .","These suggestions , including economic incentives and diplomatic measures such as a trip by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to North Korea and the conclusion of a peace declaration involving both Koreas and China , are a good starting point .","Sun-tzu , an ancient Chinese expert on the region , advised , \" Keep your friends close
