lt gen michael flynn , the head of the defense intelligence agency , made that clear when he told national public radio in an interview broadcast friday how us officials must plan for the possibility that vladimir putin 's russia has access to american battle plans and other secrets possibly taken by classified leaker edward snowden 
" if i 'm concerned about anything , i 'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked , and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries -- in this case , of course , russia , " flynn said of the former national security agency contractor who fled to moscow to seek asylum 
in the world of military strategy , every contingency must be examined , especially the worst-case scenario 
a hero to some and traitor to others , snowden last year disclosed details of the vast us surveillance network put in place after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , including how the government keeps records on billions of phone calls for possible use in terrorism investigations 
flynn told the panel that " the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow 's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm 's way  "
