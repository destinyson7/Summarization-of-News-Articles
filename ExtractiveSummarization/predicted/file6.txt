-- zambian president michael sata , who was nicknamed " king cobra " for his fiery comebacks and larger-than-life personality , has died 
sata took office in september 2011 after the incumbent president tearfully conceded in a televised speech , a rarity in a continent known for volatile elections and leaders fighting their defeat tooth-and-nail 
sata had traveled to london for unspecified medical treatment last week , and died at a hospital there tuesday evening 
he is ineligible to be elected president because his parents were not born in zambia , msiska said 
scott , who is of scottish descent , will be the first white president in sub-saharan africa since apartheid
