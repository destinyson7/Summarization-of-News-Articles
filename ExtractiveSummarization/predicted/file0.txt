nearly 16 years after a fuel tank explosion destroyed twa flight 800 , killing all 230 aboard , the federal aviation administration on friday proposed to fine boeing co $ 1357 million for failing to meet a deadline intended to prevent similar catastrophes 
the faa said boeing failed to meet a 2010 deadline to give airlines information on how to reduce fuel tank flammability , missing the deadline by 301 days for its b-747 aircraft , and by 406 days for its b-757 planes 
some 383 boeing aircraft in the united states are affected by the delays , it said 
because of the missed deadline , airlines have asked the faa for extensions to make necessary fixes , the faa said 
the july 17 , 1996 , explosion of twa 800 , a boeing 747 , was one of the deadliest accidents in aviation history , and was among the most difficult to solve
